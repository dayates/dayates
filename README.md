## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Daniel Yates

Welcome to my Github! I am an experimental nuclear physicist by training. When not working in the laboratory, I analyze large-scale nuclear physics data using modern tools. I enjoy the challenge of examining complex datasets and extracting quantities of interest. I am primarily familiar with C++, but I also have experience with Python and other analysis tools such as Mathematica, MATLAB, and Excel.
