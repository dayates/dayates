## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my Github! I am a nuclear physicist by training. Apart from my extensive hands-on experimental physics experience, I have an expertise in analyzing large-scale experimental physics data using modern tools. I am primarily familiar with C++, but I also have experience with Python and other analysis tools such as Excel, MATLAB, and Mathematica.
